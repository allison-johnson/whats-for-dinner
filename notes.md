To Do:
[] For ingredient validations: 
    - if quantity but no name, throw an error
    - if name but not quantity, throw and error
    - if neither, just don't try to create that

[] Organize Recipe Index page
    - Use a table
    - Organize by category
    - Within category, sort by popularity

[] Do I need these in my whitelisted params since I'm not using checkboxes anymore?
    :recipe_ingredients_ids
    :recipe_steps_ids

Stretch!
[] Search function searches recipe ingredients in addition to name

[] Sort recipes alphabetically OR by popularity

[] Adjust URL's for slug: /categories/chicken/recipes, rather than /categories/1/recipes

[] Error messages if new recipe reloads - including specific error on ingredient

[] Comment form on recipe show page

[] Add comments to recipe's show page and/or to user's recipe box
