To Do:
[] Hard code categories (as a constant?)

[] Homepage: what should it have?

[] Use form partials

[] Omniauth for 3rd party login

[] Organize Recipe Index page
    - Use a table
    - Organize by category
    - Within category, sort by number of saves

[] Style nav bar with bootstrap (see bookmarked link)

[] Do I need these in my whitelisted params since I'm not using checkboxes anymore?
    :recipe_ingredients_ids
    :recipe_steps_ids

Stretch!
[] Search function searches recipe ingredients in addition to name

[] Sort recipes alphabetically OR by popularity

[] Adjust URL's for slug: /categories/chicken/recipes, rather than /categories/1/recipes

[] Error messages if new recipe reloads - including specific error on ingredient

[] Comment form on recipe show page

[] Add comments to recipe's show page and/or to user's recipe box
