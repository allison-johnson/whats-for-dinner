To Do:
[] Nest recipes under categories 
    /categories/chicken/recipes -> loads chicken recipes
    /recipes -> loads all recipes

    /categories/chicken/recipes/new -> creates new chicken recipe

[] Hard code categories (as a constant?)
    Allow users to create new categories?

[] Homepage: what should it have?

[] Use a form partial

[] Omniauth for 3rd party login

[] Organize Recipe Index page
    - Use a table
    - Organize by category
    - Within category, sort by number of saves

[] Style nav bar with bootstrap (see bookmarked link)

[] Do I need these in my whitelisted params since I'm not using checkboxes anymore?
    :recipe_ingredients_ids
    :recipe_steps_ids

Stretch!
[] Search function searches recipe ingredients in addition to name

[] Sort recipes alphabetically OR by popularity

[] Error messages if new recipe reloads - including specific error on ingredient

[] Comment form on recipe show page
